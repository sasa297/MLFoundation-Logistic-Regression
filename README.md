- Import the Loan-Approval-Prediction.csv
- Use Appropriate Imputation Techniques to Predict Missing Values.
- Divide the data into training and testing set in 70:30 ratio.
- Draw Information Value Summary plot.
- Build the logistic model for checking Loan_Status with important features which we got from IV plot.
- Find out the optimum cutoff probability to reduce the missclassification error.
